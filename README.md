# AWS-WordPress-website-
wordPress website  to analyse Nginx logs

1. Need to use a cloud infrastructure automation tool like AWS CloudFormation or Terraform to automate the deployment of your WordPress website. can use pre-built templates or create own.

2. Need to use Nginx to restrict access to the website from specific IP addresses. can do this by adding the following code to  Nginx configuration file:


location / {
    allow 192.168.1.1;
    deny all;
}


This will allow access to the website only from the IP address 192.168.1.1.

3. Need to enable log rotation by adding the following code to Nginx configuration file:


access_log /var/log/nginx/access.log;
error_log /var/log/nginx/error.log;


This will create log files for Nginx access and error logs.

4. Can Use Logrotate to rotate the Nginx logs. createf a Logrotate configuration file like this:


/var/log/nginx/*.log {
    daily
    rotate 7
    compress
    missingok
    notifempty
    create 0640 nginx adm
    sharedscripts
    postrotate
        /etc/init.d/nginx reload > /dev/null
    endscript
}


This will rotate  Nginx logs daily and keep the last 7 days of logs.

5. Need to ue AWStats to analyze Nginx logs and generate reports. can install AWStats on server and configure it to read Nginx logs. AWStats will generate reports on website traffic, including the number of visitors, pages viewed, and more.
